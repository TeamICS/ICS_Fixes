This repository contains files and patches needed to build ICS for 
various devices.

patch-build_core_user_tags.mk
  Patch to "grandfather" components in build/core/user_tags.mk instead 
  of having to change LOCAL_MODULE_TAGS in Android.mk

patch-preprocessing_Android.mk
  Patch to rename frameworks/base/media/libeffects/preprocessing/Android.mk
  to avoid building libpreprocessing which depends on webrtc (ARMv5/6 issue)
